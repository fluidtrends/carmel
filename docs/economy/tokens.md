Carmel started off with an EOS-based token. It was listed on two exchanges: DEXEOS and EOSDAQ. After years of exploring EOS and being involved in the EOS ecosystem, the core team decided to move away from EOS altogether and build on other chains.

The EOS-based Carmel tokens are still on the EOS mainnet. The new Carmel tokens will be based on the Ethereum chain as ERC20 tokens. Carmel also makes use of a suite of NFTs using an original economic model. Once the new economy are operational, the EOS-based token holders will have the ability to claim their stake into the new economic model.
