## Continue defining your personal brand using Chunky

## Tasks

### 1. Change your "hero" image

This is done by modifying the chunk.json file from the intro folder.

<details>
  <summary>Want some help?</summary>
  <br />
   <p> Look for the image key under cover. </p>
</details>

### 2. Modify your button text

Modify the same file in order to change the text from your "action" button.

<details>
  <summary>Need a tip?</summary>
  <br />
   <p> Look for the primaryActionTitle key under cover. </p>
</details>

### 3. Update your button's action

Now we are going to modify the route which your button will take the user. To achieve this we need to modify the same file. (Look for events). 
even if the events key is empty you will need to add a new key called: "cover" and the new route you want to navigate.

<details>
  <summary>Looking for a tip?</summary>
  <br />
   <p> Your events key should look like this:
     ```
      "events": {
        "cover": "local://something"
      },
     ```
   </p>
</details>

### 4. Swap your button's color

As same as we did with the text, but now instead you will swap the color. But now we will go back and modify the chunky.json file.

<details>
  <summary>Find yourself stuck? Click here</summary>
  <br />
   <p> Lookup for events key and then the cover key </p>
</details>
