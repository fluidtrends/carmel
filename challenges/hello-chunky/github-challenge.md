# Github challenge
## Why?
GH is, literally, the largest host of source-code in the world with over four million users currently contributing to its more than six million repositories. Perhaps the biggest illustration of GitHub's importance is how companies choose to leverage it. Hiring managers are creating tech tests and small projects for candidates to solve as a way to vet talent.
You will need a lot of patience and google searching to solve it.
