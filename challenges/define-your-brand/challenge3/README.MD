## Finalize defining your personal brand using Chunky

## Tasks

### 1. Create a markdown file

Create a new file in the assets folder and put the .md extension to it, in order for the file to a markdown one.

### 2. Write into the markdown file

Edit your newly created file and write in it.

Describe your brand in it.

You can use [this](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to gain some super powers over the markdown file.

No tips here, use your imagination :)!

### 3. Add your markdown file to the website

To achieve this you will need to edit the chunk.json from the intro folder.

Just add the name of the file you just created in the text key.

<details>
  <summary>Looking for help?</summary>
  <br />
   <p> Check line 25. At the moment Chunky will look for intro.md file, make it look for your file. </p>
</details>

### 4. Edit your footer

In order to edit your footer section you will need to open the index.json file which is located in the web folder.

Look at the footer key.

<details>
  <summary>Need a tip?</summary>
  <br />
   <p> Look at how the sections are structured now and try to add your own items to the footer. </p>
</details>

### Now you should have finished defining your brand and have an awesome landing page!

#### Congrats!

##### Note: you can go even further, by adding more markdown files and edit more of your sections within the website.

Happy coding!
