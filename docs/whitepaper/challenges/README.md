## Challenges

A Carmel Challenge is authored by someone who is familiar with the problem at hand and is in a position to challenge someone else while providing guidance and is also able to write the validation code required. In essence, developers challenge each other to *climb the digital mountain* so to speak, a daunting task to say the least. The ultimate goal is not how far a developer grows in their career, but that they keep growing. That they keep climbing.

The central theme of the Carmel Community is the concept of a challenge. A Carmel Challenge is a technical problem to be solved that includes a **tutorial** and a **proof of learning** using validation code that tests whether the student has successfully solved the problem or not. To author, distribute and edit challenges, a Carmel Author has access to a **publishing** dashboard. Each challenge is priced and measured in Carmel Tokens which represent the learning value of the challenge itself.

#### Tutorial

The tutorial associated with a Carmel Challenge is a clear walkthrough of the problem to be solved and how it needs to be solved. The best challenge tutorials are those that can be clearly followed by someone who has never completed a similar challenge before. Each step is documented in familiar language with examples and associated relevant supporting links to external sources of information. The tutorial is written in Markdown and should read as technical blog post.

#### Proof Of Learning

Although the tutorial can be read and followed through like a blog post, and put in practice as such, Carmel requires the author goes a step further to create proof that the student undertaking the challenge has successfully completed it. This proof of learning is validated through validation code written by the challenge author at the same time as the tutorial. A challenge cannot be published unless it includes the validation code along with the tutorial. The validation code is written much like a unit test, in a framework provided by Carmel.

#### Publishing

A Carmel Author creates a challenge from their Carmel account at carmel.io and as soon as the tutorial and the validation code is ready, they are able to publish the challenge from their account. The challenge tutorial will be available at carmel.io in the form of an article, much like a blog post, and the validation code will be packaged as a bundle and held in the Carmel database, ready to be downloaded every time someone takes the challenge.

#### Tokens

The author sets a price for the challenge in Carmel Tokens and is able to update and change the price after the challenge has been published. It is important for our community to allow authors to set their own pricing. The market reaction to the challenge allows the author to adjust the pricing so that it stabilises at a fair price based on demand. In future pricing updates, Carmel will use Machine Learning to recommend optimal pricing, but the final decision of the actual price, will always remain in the hands of the author. To purchase a course, a student will have to own the required amount of tokens in their Carmel Wallet.
