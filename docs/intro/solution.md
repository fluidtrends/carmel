## The App Nation
### 10,000 Community-Owned Apps.

Making community-ownership possible when it comes to digital innovation requires us to enable contributors to own a stake in each step of the process. That means owning a stake in the governance of apps, in their management and in their development. As well as in accessing these apps.

This is where Carmel comes in.

Carmel makes this possible by introducing a suite of Digital Assets. The Carmel Assets correspond to each of the four parts of the digital innovation process:  Governance Shields, Management Lands, Development Gems and Access Cards. The Carmel Economy also includes Carmel Tokens used for governance and for payments.

The Assets are 100% human-centric, without zero dependencies on central authorities. They can be purchased, sold and traded at will in a free market economy. To bring all this together, Carmel is structured as a community of communities. Or if you will, as a Digital Nation made up of cooperative-like communities. If Carmel is a Nation, we can refer to these communities as Cities.

Governance Shields are used to govern Cities. With each City being powered by its own community-operated network run by its Citizens. Access to the City network is provided by Management Lands which are used to manage apps. One Land is used to host and manage one app. Each Land can contain Development Gems which are used to fund app development and pay developers.

App users, and every contributor in Carmel participates in the ecosystem through Access Cards which act as personal digital identities. Each Card comes with a Subscription Plan: Resident (Free), Citizen ($29/month) and Governor ($99/month).

There are a total of 10,000 Lands available to host apps. One Land, one Carmel App. Land owners rent out their Land to app owners who pay a monthly fee for hosting. App owners are able to customize their apps with pre-built chunks of functionality that can be licensed from the Carmel Store. Additionally, they can commission Quests and hire Carmel Developers to create new custom functionality.  Every time a Chunk is licensed, the original author and the one who commissioned it earn royalties.
