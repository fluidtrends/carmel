## Introduction

Chris is a 40 year old father who has the type of job that can be easily replaced by robots.

What keeps Chris up at night is the thought that soon, he might lose his job and not be able to provide for his family.

There are many people like Chris out there, holding down jobs that are at risk with the rise of AI machines.

Robots are well on their way to replace 30% of UK jobs by the early 2030s and 38% of US jobs, as [research by PWC shows](#1-workforce-of-the-future-pwc-2017) in a recent report.

Robots are changing the future of work as we know it. Any job that can be done by a robot, will be done by a robot, whether we like it or not.

So what does that mean for millions of people who are at risk today?

It means that they have to learn new skills, that will give them new job opportunities in the new AI-dominated marketplace.

It means that they have to get the kind of education that will help them hit the ground running fast and start a new career as soon as humanly possible. A future-proof career. A career that will not easily be replaced by robots and one that will create ample opportunities for a better future.

People like Chris know retraining is the solution. In a [survey by the Pew Research Center](#2-the-state-of-american-jobs-pew-research-center-2016), 54% of US workers say *"it will be essential for them to get training and develop new skills throughout their work life in order to keep up with changes in the workplace."* An additional 33% say this will be important. And 64% believe that knowing computer programming is crucial to success in today's economy.

What better way to survive in the tech world, than to become a Professional Software Developer?

While non-technical jobs will disappear, demand for Software Developers will continue to grow [according to a report by the World Economic Forum](#3-the-future-of-jobs-world-economic-forum-2016) where 350 employers were interviewed.

In the new tech-dominated era, the best career choice is to become a tech creator. One of those few people who not only survives but thrives in a tech world.
