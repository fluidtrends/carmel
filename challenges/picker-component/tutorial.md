## Create your first React Component

Creating your first Component shouldn't scare you that much.

Let's get started then.

Firstly we should create a new Javascript file.

## Time for import

**React**

Our first import import will be **React**, nothing fancy here just import it from 'react'.

**Screen and Components**

Now let's import our **Screen** and our **Components** from chunky.

**Our Picker Component**

We will import our Picker from components folder, even if we did not define it yet ( we will do this later don't worry ).

## Now let's create your Class

You should create a **default class** that will return your component. Also your class should extend **Chunky Screen**. Export your class by **default**.

Create a **components** function and return an array with **one** element and that element should be your **Picker**.

## Send some props to your component

Add **backgroundColor** property to your **Picker** and set the value to: **EEEEEE**.

Also add a **startValue** property that should have the value: **1**.
