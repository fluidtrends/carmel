## The current Web makes us less human
### Being online used to be about freedom, creativity and openness. 

But somewhere along the way, something changed. The Web started being more about algorithms than about people. Over 5 billion of us go online every day but somehow, it feels as if we're leaving part of ourselves in the digital world. As if the more we live online the less human we become. 

The current Web is broken. The way it works right now is simply dehumanizing.

The kind of digital experiences we deal with on a daily basis are literally robbing us of our humanity.

We’re asked to click on images of traffic lights to prove we’re human. Or to drag a widget to the right to prove to an algorithm that I am me. How about those cookies? Accept all these cookies before I continue? Are you kidding me?

Think about all this is doing to us.

We stare at our phones constantly. 
We spend less time with our loved ones. In real life. 
We obsess over the number of likes we get. Or the number of followers. 
And The Feed. Oh, The Feed.
And the notifications.
That ever growing digital noise. 
The invasive tracking.
The fact that we don’t even own our data. 
We don’t even own our online profiles.

We literally don’t own anything online.

Instead of growing and flourishing by being online, we’re being robbed of our dignity, of our inner peace and of so many of our human gifts. We’re in danger of losing our freedom, our creativity and our openness. 

But what if we could do something about it? What if we could fix the Web? And make it more human? What if there was a way to take our digital lives back?
