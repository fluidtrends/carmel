## Imagine a More Human World
### Where technology serves and does not dominate human experiences.

A world full of **human-centric** digital experiences. 

Experiences that allow us to take back our digital lives. And that put us back in control of being online. The kind that put us at the center of the Web.

The kind that put us at the center of shopping online. At the center of playing games, communicating, connecting, learning, working. The kind of experiences that put us at the center of the hundreds of digital experiences we depend on every day.

Imagine the **economic freedom** of buying, selling, trading, owing digital properties without being dependent on big corporations. Without feeling like just another cog in a giant heartless economic wheel. 

Or imagine the level of **unleashed creativity** possible when you're invited to contribute to the common good with like-minded people that share your values. Imagine collaborating to turn community ideas into digital experiences people love.

And just imagine the **authentic openness** of being able to say whatever you wanna say. Just imagine putting new concepts, ideas and observations out there and asking for honest feedback without having to self-censor.

> Imagine technology that serves and does not dominate human experiences. 

Where humans - not machines - are at the center of it all.

Imagine a world where we would be able to **own our online identity**. And our data. Our content, our files and everything we post online. Where we would also be able to own digital assets that are truly ours and that no one can take away from us, no matter what.

Being online should allow us to **speak our minds** and make observations and challenge ourselves and our friends with new ideas.

And on top of it all, how amazing would it be if we were **fairly compensated** for our online contributions?
