## Educational Model

<img align="center" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fluidtrends/carmel/master/images/education.png">

One of the major drawbacks of most available online education is that much too often it's merely an extension of the traditional classroom, using technology. In a typical online video learning model, which dominates the current tech educational model, the teacher lectures the student via video, much like a traditional teacher would lecture students in a college classroom.

In the real world, at the office, software developers learn in a much more direct and hands-on way. They are rarely lectured and are much more self-directed. The knowledge is shared from peer to peer and the learning experience is highly personal and self-determined. The content is also broken down into much smaller pieces than a typical lecture and it's usually very specific to a problem to be solved.

Carmel is designed from scratch to implement an Educational Model that is based on solid principles collected from real-world experiences working in the Software Industry. It is a radical departure from the typical video-based lecture model and it is aimed to create a learning experience much closer to how professional software developers learn on an on-going basis, rather than mirroring how computer science is taught in a traditional college setting.

With Carmel, developers engage in a **hands on**, **microlearning** model that is **self-directed**, **peer driven** and **story-based**.

#### Hands On

Learning with Carmel, the student is exposed to a way of doing things that feels very real. As real as if they were in an office, working on a real-world problem for a real-world product. The Carmel Learning Experience ensures that every Carmel Student gets their hands dirty doing real work. At the end of the work assignment, the student learned something but also created something new and so they gain not only raw knowledge *about* a concept but also new *skills* and put them in practice right away.

#### Microlearning

The hands on learning assignments are designed to be small enough to be undertaken in a few minutes of spare time. Each assignment is called a Challenge and it provides an opportunity to learn a small and specific skill about solving one problem. This is exactly how real world tech learning happens in a learning environment where software developers thrive and are continously improving their skills.

#### Self-Directed

Carmel Students design their own learning path by choosing which Carmel Challenge to undertake next and when. A Carmel Learning Path is very personal in that given enough challenges, no two paths will be similar and no two paths will be undertaken the same way by two different students. One might take longer to complete a challenge and they might complete it in a different way or a different style. At the end of the day, the result will be a unique and personal Learning Journey that clearly outlines what the student knows and how well they know the concepts they've learned.

#### Peer Driven

The Carmel Community is comprised of Software Developers who are at different levels in their Developer Journey. Some are brand new and others more experienced. Nonetheless, everyone always has something to learn from everyone else. Not one person will ever know enough on their own. Carmel enables each community member to contribute knowledge back into the community in the form of Carmel Challenges based on personal experience. Someone who has solved a problem in a certain way in the past has the relevant knowledge and skills to challenge someone else to acquire that same knowledge and develop those same skills. In a sense, the more a student learns, the more they can give back and also become a teacher to others.

#### Story-Based

Every Carmel Developer is encouraged to keep a Developer Journal that actively documents their Learning Journey. Each developer has their own story and others can participate in that story by connecting, conversing and engaging as their own story develops. Carmel generates story elements based on challenges which the developer either authored or completed and there is also a measure of progress that shows how much the developer knows and what it is that they can do as a software developer.
