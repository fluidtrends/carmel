Chris is a 40 year old father who has the type of job that can be easily replaced by robots. What keeps Chris up at night is the thought that soon, he might lose his job and not be able to provide for his family. There are many people like Chris out there, holding down jobs that are at risk with the rise of AI machines.

Robots are well on their way to replace 30% of UK jobs by the early 2030s and 38% of US jobs, as research by PWC shows in a recent report. Robots are changing the future of work as we know it. Any job that can be done by a robot, will be done by a robot, whether we like it or not.

**Tech Education Is The Only Solution**

So what does that mean for millions of people who are at risk today? It means that they have to learn new skills, that will give them new job opportunities in the new AI-dominated marketplace. It means that they have to get the kind of education that will help them hit the ground running fast and start a new career as soon as humanly possible. A future-proof career. A career that will not easily be replaced by robots and one that will create ample opportunities for a better future.  

What better way to survive in the tech world, than to become a Professional Software Developer? While non-technical jobs will disappear, demand for Software Developers will continue to grow according to a report by the World Economic Forum.

In the new tech-dominated era, the best career choice is to become a tech creator. One of those few people who not only survives but thrives in a tech world.

**Blockchain-Based Tech Education The Carmel Way**

Carmel is a Decentralized Tech Education Platform that helps people like Chris acquire the technical skills they need to become Professional Software Developers without a formal computer science degree. Carmel runs on the EOS Blockchain, using Next Generation Blockchain Technology.

The groundbreaking Carmel Educational Model focuses on teaching hands-on technical skills. The kind of skills Chris will need if he is to build a future-proof career. The Carmel Way is a step forward from the current educational models of traditional classroom-based and video-based learning. Our model is skills-based, decentralized and tokenized, using the concept of Peer Technical Challenges.

We introduce the concept of a Carmel Token as a unit of measure for skill, much like a meter is a unit of measure for distance or a gram is a unit of measure for weight. The community creates the challenges and the community also benefits from taking the challenges while earning Experience Points, which serve as Proof of Learning.
