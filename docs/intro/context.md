## Redefining the future of apps
### Human-centric and 100% aligned with our interests. 

To build a more human Web that puts us at the center of our digital lives, we have to start from the beginning. First, we had websites. The good old days when digital content was static and being online pretty much meant browsing web pages and reading.

Then, websites grew into apps. Web apps, mobile apps, voice apps, lots of apps. Our digital lives literally depend on all the apps we use on a daily basis. Here’s the thing though. All the apps we use today are governed, managed and developed by a handful of big corporations. And corporations need to do what corporations need to do. That is, operate at a profit, scale and generate as much revenue as possible.

Fine, but the problem is that there’s a grossly disproportionate misalignment between corporate interests and user interests. When our digital lives are in the hands of trillion dollar corporations, that’s not a good thing. Look, if adding a “like button” increases revenues but also increases the likelihood of mental health occurrences in the midst of millennials - what do you do as a corporation? Well, you most probably add the button and deal with the ethical consequences later - or not deal with them at all.  

Here’s something else to keep in mind. Technology keeps evolving. Just like websites turned into apps, now apps are growing into something else altogether.

After websites and apps, we’re now entering a third era - the era of superapps. Gartner predicts that 50% of users will be using superapps by 2027.

Bigger, more complex and packed with composable third-party functionality. We will depend on these superapps even more than we depend on the apps we use today. It’s not hard to imagine a future where the Web is dominated by only a handful of superapps that are governed, managed and developed by trillion dollar corporations. Superapps designed to put corporate interests first. By design, those corporate interests will not always align with the interests of the users.

To reimagine a more human Web, we need to reimagine the future of apps. We need to imagine a human-centric superapp. One where users are the heart of it all and where the microapps within it are completely aligned with community interests. And most importantly, we need to imagine a superapp that is owned by people in a cooperative-like model, not by a corporation.
